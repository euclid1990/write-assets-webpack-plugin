  <h1>Write Assets Webpack Plugin</h1>
  <p>Force webpack-dev-server/webpack-dev-middleware/webpack-hot-middleware program to write bundle files to the file system.</p>
</div>

## Problem

The `webpack-dev-server` (even when you use `webpack-dev-middleware/webpack-hot-middleware`) doesn't write files to disk.

Relate issue on [webpack-dev-server repository](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/62) | [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33318457/bundle-js-file-output-and-webpack-dev-server).

If you want to force webpack-dev-server to write to the file system, you can use this plugin.

## Install

```bash
  npm i --save-dev write-assets-webpack-plugin
```
```bash
  yarn add --dev write-assets-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

```js
const WriteAssetsWebpackPlugin = require('write-assets-webpack-plugin');
...
// Webpack configuration
module.exports = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  ...
  plugins: [
    new WriteAssetsWebpackPlugin({ force: true, extension: ['js'] })
  ]
}
```

See [Example](./example).
